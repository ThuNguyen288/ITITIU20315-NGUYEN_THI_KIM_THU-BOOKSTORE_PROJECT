It\'s a time when the growing threat of fascism in Europe is a constant worry, and people escape from reality through radio and the movies. Meanwhile, the two sisters -- vastly different in personality, yet inextricably linked by a shared past -- try to find their places within the complex web of social expectations for young women in the 1930s. While Nora embarks on a glamorous career as a radio-soap opera star, Clara, a strong and independent-minded woman, struggles to observe the traditional boundaries of a small and tight-knit community without relinquishing her dreams of love, freedom, and adventure. However, things aren\'t as simple as they appear -- Nora\'s letters eventually reveal life in the big city is less exotic than it seems, and the tranquil solitude of Clara\'s life is shattered by a series of unforeseeable events.

It shows how cyberpunk\'s revolutionary claims conceal its ultimate conservatism on matters of class, gender, and race. The cyberfeminists writing here view cyberculture as a social experiment with an as-yet-unfulfilled potential to create new identities, relationships, and cultures. The book brings together women\'s cyberfiction—fiction that explores the relationship between people and virtual technologies—and feminist theoretical and critical investigations of gender and technoculture. From a variety of viewpoints, the writers consider the effects of rapid and profound technological change on culture, in particular both the revolutionary and reactionary effects of cyberculture on women\'s lives.

Bush’s 2002 State of the Union address linked international terrorists to Iran, Iraq, and North Korea. But that was only one moment during a crucial time in American history, when a president, an administration, and a country were transformed. Frum worked with President Bush in the Oval Office, traveled with him aboard Air Force One, and studied him closely at meetings and events. He describes how Bush thinks—what this conservative president believes about religion, race, the environment, Jews, Muslims, and America’s future. Frum takes us behind the scenes of one of the most secretive administrations in recent history, with revealing portraits of Karl Rove, Karen Hughes, Condoleezza Rice, and many others. Most significant, he tells the story of the transformation of George W. Bush: how a president whose administration began in uncertainty became one of the most decisive, successful, and popular leaders of our time. Before becoming a White House speechwriter, David Frum was a highly regarded author of books and political commentary and an influential voice on the pages ofThe Wall Street JournalandThe Weekly Standard.His commentary has been described by William F. Buckley as “the most refreshing ideological experience in a generation.” Now, inThe Right Man,we see Frum as a front-row observer and participant. Not since Peggy Noonan’s account of her time in the Reagan White House has an insider portrayed a sitting president with such precision, verve, honest admiration, and insight. The Right Manwill command international attention for its thoughtful account of George W. Bush in the midst of his greatest challenge. It will be an essential reference for anyone seeking to understand who our president really is and how he is likely to lead us in the future.

Was it murder or self-defense? For nearly a decade, the shooting and its aftermath reverberated throughout this hauntingly beautiful city of moss-hung oaks and shaded squares. In this sharply observed, suspenseful, and witty narrative, John Berendt skillfully interweaves a hugely entertaining first-person account of life in this isolated remnant of the Old South with the unpredictable twists and turns of a landmark murder case. It is a spellbinding story peopled by a gallery of remarkable characters: the well-bred society ladies of the Married Woman’s Card Club; the turbulent young gigolo; the hapless recluse who owns a bottle of poison so powerful it could kill every man, woman, and child in Savannah; the aging and profane Southern belle who is the “soul of pampered self-absorption”; the uproariously funny drag queen; the acerbic and arrogant antiques dealer; the sweet-talking, piano-playing con artist; young people dancing the minuet at the black debutante ball; and Minerva, the voodoo priestess who works her magic in the graveyard at midnight.

By developing a wealthy mind-set, anyone can take off into financial self-reliance -- and Allen shows you how.

El fallo del jurado, por primera vez en la historia de este premio, fue unánime. Y no es para menos, ya que nos encontramos ante una primera novela que no sólo introduce a sus lectores en una hermosa y densa fantasía erótica, sino que les revela a una auténtica escritora. Irene González Frei dedica su novela a Marina , «de todos los personajes de esta historia el único cuyo nombre no he tenido el valor de cambiar», y cede la palabra a Sofía para que sea ella la que nos cuente, desde el recuerdo, «ese amor vertiginoso entre las grietas del dolor y el desconsuelo» que las unirá para siempre y fundirá sus cuerpos, más allá del tenue cristal de los espejos, en el reflejo de Narciso. Sofía , una joven al parecer como tantas otras, vive en Madrid en el seno de un grupo de amigos que comparten inquietudes y amores. Tras el matrimonio con Santiago, cuyas relaciones sexuales se extreman en la violencia a medida que el tiempo va corroyendo el afecto y las apetencias, Sofía , desencantada y triste, encuentra un día a Marina . Entre las dos se establece instantáneamente una atracción singular, casi mágica. Emprenden un viaje por Italia con destino a Roma, donde a Marina le espera un trabajo en una organización internacional. Poco a poco, de manera irresistible, el lector irá impregnándose de la progresiva compenetración de las dos mujeres, de la gradual fusión de sus cuerpos hasta el punto de que ya no parecen sino una sola.

Born in the midst of tragedy and violence and raised in the shadow of a shocking secret, young Angelo Vestieri chooses to flee both his past and his father to seek a second family—the criminals who preside over early 20th century New York. In his bloody rise from soldier to mob boss, he encounters ever more barbaric betrayals—in friendship, in his brutal business, in love—yet simultaneously comes to understand the meaning of loyalty, the virtue of relationships, and gains a perspective on the lonely, if powerful, life he has chosen. As the years pass, as enemies are made and defeated, as wars are fought and won, the old don meets an abandoned boy who needs a parent as much as protection. By taking Gabe under his wing and teaching him everything he knows, Angelo Vestieri will learn, in the winter of his life, which is greater: his love for the boy he cherishes, or his need to be a gangster and to live by the savage rules he helped create. A sweeping panoramic with riveting characters, a unique understanding of the underworld philosophy, and a relentless pace, Gangster travels through the time of godfathers and goodfellas to our own world of suburban Sopranos.

For the farming Pye family, life is a Greek tragedy where the sins of the fathers are visited on the sons, and terrible events occur—offstage. Centerstage are the Morrisons, whose tragedy looks more immediate if less brutal, but is, in reality, insidious and divisive. Orphaned young, Kate Morrison was her older brother Matt’s protegee, her fascination for pond life fed by his passionate interest in the natural world.

And she thinks she’s outgrown her siblings—Luke, Matt, and Bo—who were once her entire world.

Each wave different, and each wave stronger. The Martian Chronicles Ray Bradbury is a storyteller without peer, a poet of the possible, and, indisputably, one of America\'s most beloved authors. In a much celebrated literary career that has spanned six decades, he has produced an astonishing body of work: unforgettable novels, including Fahrenheit 451 and Something Wicked This Way Comes; essays, theatrical works, screenplays and teleplays; The Illustrated Mein, Dandelion Wine, The October Country, and numerous other superb short story collections. But of all the dazzling stars in the vast Bradbury universe, none shines more luminous than these masterful chronicles of Earth\'s settlement of the fourth world from the sun. Bradbury\'s Mars is a place of hope, dreams and metaphor-of crystal pillars and fossil seas-where a fine dust settles on the great, empty cities of a silently destroyed civilization. It is here the invaders have come to despoil and commercialize, to grow and to learn -first a trickle, then a torrent, rushing from a world with no future toward a promise of tomorrow. The Earthman conquers Mars ... and then is conquered by it, lulled by dangerous lies of comfort and familiarity, and enchanted by the lingering glamour of an ancient, mysterious native race. Ray Bradbury\'s The Martian Chronicles is a classic work of twentieth-century literature whose extraordinary power and imagination remain undimmed by time\'s passage. In connected, chronological stories, a true grandmaster once again enthralls, delights and challenges us with his vision and his heart-starkly and stunningly exposing in brilliant spacelight our strength, our weakness, our folly, and our poignant humanity on a strange and breathtaking world where humanity does not belong.',354190,100,1,10,5,261365,'RAY BRADBURY','Spectra','1984','22,24,28,44',NULL,NULL,4.33,'2025-05-12 11:49:25',3,'active',NULL),(156,'Fahrenheit 451','First pub. 1954.
